## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
